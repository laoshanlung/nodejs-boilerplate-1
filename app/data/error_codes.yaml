      This error is specifically for `message/create` APIs (both in chatbox and conversation). Once having this error, the `params` will have `type` attribute to indicate the specific error, for example

      ~~~json
      {
        "params": {
          "type": "empty_message",
          "description": "Empty message"
        }
      }
      ~~~

      The current user does not have permission to perform the action. The difference between this error code and 40302 is that there is nothing the client should do about this case, just show the error message to whoever trying to illegally access the chatbox
